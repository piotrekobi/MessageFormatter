# Message Formatter

## This application makes it easier to quickly write messages that summarise your daily work

The current features include:

- Convering GitHub PR and JIRA tags (eg. #38686 or PADDLEQ-1469) to links to their corresponding webpages
- Saving the tags used in a file
- Easily adding saved tags to the current message
- Adding messages about common tasks by clicking checkboxes that correspond to them

After writing the messages in the application, they can be copied to the clipboard in HTML format, which makes it possible to paste them to a Microsoft Teams message in a formatted state.
